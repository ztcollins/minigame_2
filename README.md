## Game Design 2 First Project

This game was created within a week for Game Design 2.

This is a one button game that features a dog that is trying to take your homework. Your goal as the player is to get your homework back from your dog in a sort of "tug of war".

There is a dog that changes state and requires the player to change their strategy. There is health and dog energy that must be considered based on what mood the dog is in.

This is a Unity 3D game with no name. This game features basic programatic movement and scene management. There is also a lot of UI elements that display resources necessary for the player to win the game.
